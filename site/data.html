						<h2>Completed Items Database</h2>

						<h3>Saving the XML Data to a Database</h3>
						<p>At this point, all of the heavy lifting is done!  You can rest easy, knowing that in a few short minutes you will have a database full of completed eBay items.  Just a reminder, this is for educational purposes only.  Saving completed item data is a violation of eBay Terms & Conditions.  You have been warned.<br><br>
						Full tutorials on creating, editing and managing MySQL databases are available all over the internet so I will spare you those details.  Instead, I just wanted to flesh out a quick tweak on our previous PHP program that will allow you to store the item data instead of print it out on the screen.
						</p>
						<img src="database.jpg" alt="PHP Program">
						<p>You can see in this example that we open up a connection to our database and then within the foreach loop, we define the item variables we wish to save and then save them into our database.  With each loop a new item is being added to the database until there are no items left.<br><br>

						And there you have it!  By following these simple instructions, you can use the eBay API to create a quasi-legal database full of market information that you can capitalize on to become a multi-millionaire.  When you do, make sure and donate some of that money to Oregon State since that is where you learned this nifty trick!<br>
